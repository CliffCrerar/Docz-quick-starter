# How to

## Detailed config docs

These configs explained in this section are just enough to get you going with [docz](https://www.docz.site). For the most up to date details on configuration and administration please visit [this link](https://www.docz.site/docs/introduction). Note that this app is still a beta so the documents are a tad limited at the moment but I am sure that this will improve with time. If you look this the `docz` [git project](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) you will find that there are a lot of flavours of this app in use already most notably [Best of Javascript](https://bestofjs.org/).

## Adding pages

Out of the box you can add pages wherever you like and the app will pick them up if they have a `.mdx` extension. For this setup you must add pages in the `src` folder. I like to keep things neat so all the existing pages are in the `pages` folder. To enable the app to see your pages you have to at least specify and 'name' and a `route`. Here is an example:

```mdx
---
name: Awesome new page
route: /awesome-new-page
---
```

Just add this baby to the top of each page and you are good to doc *(you see what I did there?)*.

## Ordering pages

You will find that as you add pages the app will order them alpabetically according to the name in the page definition header described in the previous section, this is not an ideal situation. Luckily there is a simple way to order pages.

Inside the `src` folder you will see a `menu` folder, the `index.js` has an array of page names:

```js
module.exports = [
    'Landing',
    'Some how to`s',
    'Page Z',
    'Page A',
    'Readme'
]
```

This array is a list of the names that are specified in the page definition headers, the `name` of the page you specify in the definition header must be exact otherwise you will have an unordered page in the list with a dead page with no content in the side navigation. The functionality of this is very apparant when you look at the current ordering of `Page A` and `Page Z`.

## Colors and Theming

Very basically this recipe of the `docz` app only uses the `docz-theme-default`. Although this is a default it is still somewhat configurable. But note that it behaves strangely. Pop open the `doczrc.js` in the project root, and you will see that out of the box the colors are setup as follows:

```js
    //theme: 'docz-theme-default',
    themeConfig: {
        // mode: 'dark',
        colors: {
            primary: 'tomato'
        },
        logo: {
            src: 'https://now-static-cdn.c1i44.now.sh/svg/docz.logo.svg',
            width: 150,
        }
    },
```

Removing the `colors` attribute completely, the app will revert back to default colors. Which still very sleek. 

```js
    //theme: 'docz-theme-default',
    themeConfig: {
        // mode: 'dark',
        // colors: {
        //     primary: 'tomato'
        // },
        logo: {
            src: 'https://now-static-cdn.c1i44.now.sh/svg/docz.logo.svg',
            width: 150,
        }
    },
```

If you are dark and like dark things simple do change this part of the config as follows:


```js
    //theme: 'docz-theme-default',
    themeConfig: {
        mode: 'dark',
        // colors: {
        //     primary: 'tomato'
        // },
        logo: {
            src: 'https://now-static-cdn.c1i44.now.sh/svg/docz.logo.svg',
            width: 150,
        }
    },
```

> ### **WARNING:** This will not give you errors in the build nor in the web console if you miss a comma or somehow misconfigure it. **Be cautious.** 

You will find a lot more on this subject in the [offical documentation](https://www.docz.site/docs/creating-themes).

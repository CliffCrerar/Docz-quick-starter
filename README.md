# `docz` quick start

> Quickly start using docs with this preconfigured instance of docz, no need to have to ruffle through the config documents.

## User assumptions

* You are comfortable using the `node package manager` `npm` in the command line environment.
* You have a understanding of how to use markdown.
* (Optional) You know how to use `React`, altough  `docz` is built on a `.mdx` framework, knowing how to use react will help you to create more dynamic content, you will be able to use it just fine writing `mdx` only.

## Creating instance of docs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CliffCrerar/Docz-quick-starter.git
cd Docz-quick-starter
npm install
npm start
```


When `npm start` is run the browser should pop open with your shiny new docz instance.

See the example app [here](https://docz-quick-starter.c1i44.now.sh). 

[`Docz` Official](https://www.docz.site/)

If you are wondering where the rest is, this is a documents app so the rest of your questions will be answered once you have the app running.

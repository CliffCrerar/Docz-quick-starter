# DOCZ quick start

> Quickly start using docs with this preconfigured instance of docz, no need to have to ruffle through the config documents.

## User assumptions

* You are comfortable using the `node package manager` `npm` in the command line environment.
* You have a understanding of how to use markdown.
* (Optional) You know how to use `React`, althoug this `docz` is built to be a `.mdx` library knowing react will go a long way when using `docs` you will be able to get along without using `React`.

## Creating instance of docs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CliffCrerar/Docz-quick-starter.git
cd Docz-quick-starter
npm install
npm start
```
When `npm start` is run the browser should pop open with your shiny new docz instance.

If you are wondering where the rest is, this is a documents app so the rest of your questions will be answered once you have the app running.

## Special thanks
